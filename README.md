###  [Notes](https://autumn-amount-0be.notion.site/Introduction-f7429525669b47e5a3dabc9bed0b1d78)

## Three Core Concepts of Redux
1. Store - Holds state of an application.
2. Action - Describes what happened.
3. Reducer - Ties store and action together.

## Three Principles of Redux
1. State of whole application is stored in an object tree within a single store.
2. The only way to change the state is to emit an action, an object describing what happened.
3. To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write pure reducers.
